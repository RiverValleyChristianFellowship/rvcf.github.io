<h2>Church Leaders</h2>
<p><span class="lead">The Holy Spirit represents Christ on earth.</span><br />
Of course, it is not enough to recognize the truths of Scripture if we do not act on them.  any claim to be Bible-believing churches, and we thank God for that.  But we must also to be a Bible-obeying church by the work of the Spirit of God in us.  It is of the utmost importance that the Holy Spirit be given His place in the local assembly.  His power is the only power for worship, ministry, or evangelism.  It is easy to displace Him by substituting human arrangements.  It is common in many congregations to have one man to preside as minister or pastor, with activities under his control.  However it is the Spirit who is to direct the saints in their meetings (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor+12;14&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 12 & 14</a>).</p>

<p><span class="lead">For the guidance of the assembly, elders are appointed by the Spirit.</span><br />
From <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+20:17-38&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Acts 20:17-38</a>, we see that the terms "<span class="bible">elders</span>" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+20:17,28&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">v.17</a>) and "<span class="bible">overseers</span>" (bishops, see margin, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+20:17,28&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">v.28</a>) are used of the same individuals and are applied to those who "<span class="bible">take heed . . . to the flock</span>" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+20:17,28&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">v.28</a>).  In other words, elders, overseers (or bishops), and pastors (or shepherds) are all describing the same workers in the church.  Elder emphasizes their maturity; overseer emphasizes their responsibility; shepherd emphasizes their ministry-to heed, lead, and feed the local flock.  These men (the words are always used in the plural) are to fulfill the qualifications given in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Timothy+3&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Timothy 3</a> and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Titus+1&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Titus 1</a>.  Our elders are to be respected, prayed for, and obeyed (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Heb+13:7,17&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Heb. 13:7,17</a>).</p>
