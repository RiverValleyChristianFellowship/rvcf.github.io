<center><h1><b>The Good News </b></h1></center>
   <p>Can you understand that you're guilty before God? Do you want to be saved from your sins? If so, you're ready for the good news. God shows us our sinful condition, so that He can show us His solution to our problem. Romans 6:23 says,&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
   What is this gift? 1st Tim.1:15;&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">Christ Jesus came in to the world to save sinners of whom I am chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
   John 3:16-17&amp36;&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. …He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.</span>
   </p>
   <p>Jesus wants you to come to Him and be set free from the bondage of sin. Matthew 11:28-30;&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">"Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
   2nd Peter 3:9;&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, <u>not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
   To repent means to turn away from a sinful way, to God's way. Coming God's way begins by trusting in what Christ has done for sinners at the cross. The gospel is so simple that, sadly, many people won't receive it! Simply&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">come</span>
   ,&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">call on the Lord</span>
   ,&nbsp;(
   <span class="bible">Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved!</span>&nbsp;
   -Rom.10:13) and&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">believe&nbsp;</span>
   in Jesus who gave His life for us. He did all that was necessary to bring us eternal life. Acts 16:31;&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
   He is the only way. John 14:6;&nbsp;
   <span class="bible">Jesus said, 'I am the Way the Truth and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through Me.'</span>
