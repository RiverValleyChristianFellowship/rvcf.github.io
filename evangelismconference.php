<h1>Details</h1>
</h4><ul>  <li>Lodging: Local families will host guests. If you need a place to stay please contact Ashley or Nathan Hanson 715.450.1534</li>  <li>Speakers/Workshop Leaders: Tentative speakers/seminar leaders are Eric Smith and Brian Glaser. However, these and others will be doing more hands on training than pulpit ministry. We will probably only have one or two normal sessions, so if you are coming to sit on a pew, then don't come. </li>  <li>Registration: Please fill out form below</li>  <li>Questions: Call 715.450.1534 or e-mail hand2theplough@gmail.com</li>   <li>Cost: The event costs as much as salvation costs lost sinners.  </li><li>Schedule: Available upon request. e-mail natejhanson@gmail.com  </li>

<h2>Who is it for?</h2></p><p>Anyone who knows Christ as Savior and desires to learn or exercise in His glorious gospel with lost souls. If you have a desire to share the gospel but have a hard time and don't know where to start, or feel unqualified then you are just the kind of person the Lord wants for His work. (2 Cor. 12:9)</p><p>

<h2>What is an evangelism conference?</h2></p>Evangelism isn't just the subject we are studying, but it is what we will be doing for a significicant part of the time. Conferences are God's idea. They were held 3 times per year in Jerusalem and Psalms were written for such occasions. The idea of this event is that of a Biblical conference, where rather than just pulpit ministry, we will exercise in sessions of prayer and supplication as well as actual designated time for gospel outreach. (James 1:22) We will also have some time designated for general fellowship and practical evangelistic training workshop seminars!  We hope to model Biblical evangelism as closely as we can while equipping and encouraging those attending to be more active in evangelism in their own local fellowships. </p><p>

<p><h2>Where is it located?</h2>Chippewa Falls Sr. Citizen Center (meeting place of <a href="http://www.rivervalleyfellowship.org/" target="_blank">River Valley Christian Fellowship</a> 1000 E. Grand Ave., CF, WI 54729) will be the main meeting location, but events will also be held at Nathan and Ashley's home (516 Bridgewater Ave. Chippewa Falls, WI 54729). <p>

<h2>When does it happen?</h2>The event will run from October 14th through October 16th. We will meet at the Senior Center at 6:00 PM on Friday October 14th and the conference will officially conclude on Sunday afternoon at around 1:30 PM.
If any wants to stay a day late to help with follow-up for the outreach, please let me know, we really appreciate it. Please mention it in your comments when you register and we will arrange for you to stay at the appropriate house</p><p>


<h2>Notes:</h2></p><p><ul>    
<li>RIDES: If you want to come and aren't sure a ride is available, let me know! Someone is probably coming from your area as we have people coming from several directions and they just might have some extra room in the car to work out a car pool!
	</li>

<li>MUSICAL TALENTS: Please bring your instruments, voices, and practiced songs (for special numbers) to share at possibly a nursing home, and/or with each other. This can be a great tool for evangelism. If you have talents that you don't know where to put it, let us know and we will see about directing you somewhere.
