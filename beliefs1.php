Those meeting at River Valley Christian Fellowship are non-denominational and follow the example of the early Church, which met together for teaching, for fellowship, for breaking of bread (the Lord’s Supper), and for prayer <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+2:42&version=NKJV" target="_blank" >(Acts 2:42)</a>  We have no enrolled membership. Church membership requires nothing more than being saved by God <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+2:47&version=NKJV" target="_blank">(Acts 2:47)</a>. All who know the Lord Jesus Christ as a personal Savior are thereby constituted members of the true Church, the body of Christ <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor+12:12-13&version=NKJV" target="_blank">(1 Cor. 12:12-13)</a>. Those who are sound in life and doctrine are welcome to fellowship with us. We are known by biblical names such as believers <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+5:14&version=NKJV" target="_blank">(Acts 5:14)</a>, Christians <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+11:26&version=NKJV" target="_blank">(Acts 11:26)</a>, saints <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Philippians+1:1&version=NKJV" target="_blank">(Phil. 1:1)</a>, and brethren <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+20:31&version=NKJV" target="_blank">(Acts 20:32)</a>.
