<p>We are a group of believers saved by grace though faith in Christ and His finished work 
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ephesians+2:8-9&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">(Eph. 2:8-9)</a> who meet simply around the Lord Jesus, seeking to follow only the directions given in the New Testament.  Currently we are a small group, meeting in the Senior Citizen Center in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin (Chippewa Falls is a small town bordering Eau Claire).</p>
