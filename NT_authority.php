<h2>Our Authority</h2>
<p><span class="lead">A New Testament assembly takes the Bible as authoritative and complete.</span><br />
We believe firmly in the historic doctrines of the church.  However, rather than subscribing to man-made creeds, rules, and constitutions, we find the Word of God to be the only infallible statement of Christian faith and practice (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2+Tim+3:16&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">2 Tim. 3:16</a>).  The Scriptures should be appealed to directly in a gracious and humble spirit (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2+Tim+2:25&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">2 Tim. 2:25</a>) to settle all disputes, give directives to the assembly, and provide the basis for all public and private ministry.
