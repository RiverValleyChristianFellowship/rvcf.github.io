# [](#header-1) OUR RECOMMENDED ONLINE RESOURCES

1. [Weekly Meditations with Bruce](http://bdcministries.com/) - Bruce Collins is a friend of RVCF and has visited several times. We always enjoy his weekly meditations.
2. [Story Book Lodge](www.storybooklodge.org) - Story Book Lodge Christian Camp is a faith-based (free of charge) camp in Northern MN. It is an incredible place and a home away from home for many in our fellowship.
3. [Uplook Ministries](www.uplook.org) - For those who don't have as much time or patience to read a book (or even those that do!) this is an excellent stop for some wonderful gems from God's Word on video and more! We have appreciated having J.B. Nicholson and others come to speak on occasion at RVCF.
