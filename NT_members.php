<h2>Church Members</h2>
<p><span class="lead">A truly scriptural assembly should be composed only of true believers.</span>
By this we mean people who, believing the gospel, have experienced the miracle of new birth, and know themselves to be "children of God by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gal+3:26&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Gal. 3:26</a>).  We are "<span class="bible">not ashamed of the gospel</span>" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rom+1:16&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Rom. 1:16</a>) and seek to share it with others.
<br />Unconverted people cannot truly participate in worship or other holy activities of the church, nor could they be expected to support its testimony by holy living.  Christians are exhorted not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2+Cor+6:14-18&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">2 Cor. 6:14-18</a>), although we should do good to them and show them by our lives that we belong to the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What about membership?</span><br />
Strictly speaking, the only church membership spoken about in the New Testament refers to the act of placing a new believer into the Body of Christ.  This happens the moment one is saved (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor+12:27;Eph+5:30&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 12:27; Eph. 5:30</a>).  We have no member's list, but do receive into fellowship those whom Christ has already received (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rom+15:17;Rom+16:1-2&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Rom. 15:7; 16:1-2</a>).  The whole assembly is happy to receive all who<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) confess Jesus Christ as personal Saviour and Lord; and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) have a consistent Christian life and testimony.<br />
Being received into this fellowship means you are ready to embrace the privileges of local church life and willing to accept your responsibilities with us.  These include regular attendance at the meetings of the church (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+2:42;Heb+10:25&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Acts 2:42; Heb. 10:25</a>), the exercise of your gift for the upbuilding of others (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Pet+4:10&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Pet. 4:10</a>), submitting to one another, especially in obedience to the elders (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Heb+13:17&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Heb. 13:17</a>), and sharing as the Lord enables you in the financial needs of the assembly (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor+16:1-2;2+Cor+9:7&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 16:1-2; 2 Cor. 9:7</a>) as an act of worship (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Heb+13:16&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Heb. 13:16</a>).  You will notice that funds are not solicited, especially not from unbelievers (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=3+john+1:7&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">3 Jn. 1:7</a>).</p>
