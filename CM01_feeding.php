<h1>WHAT ARE YOU FEEDING ON?</h1>

<b class="bible">Duet. 8:3 "Man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord."</b>  When you get hungry, you find something to eat, right?  How long would you live if you didn't?  Doctors say a matter of days.  What about your soul?  When was the last time you fed it?  Did you know it is fed by the word of God?  Like the verse above tells us, we won't live by food alone but by God's word.  I am surrounded by people who are well provided for (including myself).  But like I was before, they hardly ever/if ever read the Bible.  Spiritually they're dead.  Sadly some of these claim to be Christians.
<p><b><u>God's word saves.</u></b>
<br />Jesus said in <b class="bible">John 8:51 <span class="bibleRed">"Most assuredly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death."</span></b>  Do you know what these words are?  FIND OUT!  <b class="bible">I Pet. 2:2 "...desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow..."</b>  Jesus prayed this to the Father; <b class="bible">John 17:17 <span class="bibleRed">"Sanctify them by Your truth.  Your word is truth."</span></b>  God's word is truth and can save you from death (hell).  I see people carried away with all kinds of crazy stuff.  Every time some new yo yo comes along with an idea they fall for it.  Why?  Because they don't know the truth.  Did you know that Islam, Hinduism, and so on would have never gotten started had the founders known God's word?  They were deceived just like Adam and Eve because they didn't heed God's word.  How many lies do you believe right now?
<p><b><u>God's word is powerful.</u></b>
<br /><b class="bible">Hebrews 4:12 "For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." </b> It touches every part of our lives- relationships, money, government, but most importantly our relationship to God-the forgiveness of sins!
<p><b><u>God's word is trustworthy.</u></b>
<br /><b class="bible">II Tim. 3:16 "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."</b> And again, <b class="bible">II Pet. 2:20 "knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."</b>  Do you question the Bible to be real?  This is a brief response.  Besides over 250,000 archeological finds, and besides the witness of creation, how could a book written over the course of 1500 years by several different authors agree with 100% accuracy?  And how could these writings by all different authors predict the future of times, places and events that would take place with 100% accuracy?  Did you know that secular men (non-believers) say the chance of that happening is 1 with 26 zeros behind it?  The Bible is real and it's here to stay.  Jesus said in <b class="bible">Matt. 24:35 <span class="bibleRed">"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away."</span></b>
God has perfectly preserved His word for us and its purpose is not rules and regulations to live by (religion).  Its purpose is to save us and guide us DAILY.  Jesus said in <b class="bible">John 10:10 <span class="bibleRed">"I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."</span></b>  Have you accepted this life?  I did in September of 1999.  God saved me and He wants to save you too.  Read for yourself.
