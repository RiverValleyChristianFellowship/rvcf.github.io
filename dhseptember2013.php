<p>9/16/13 (Rachel Hanson)
We are home!
<br>
I was expecting lots of work and I've got it. David has done exceptionally well with the transfer to home and we are so thankful for your prayers in this huge transition.
I am very busy taking phone calls, taking care of baby, and all David's needs. When we arrived boxes of supplies were still unpacked and we quickly found out that there were several things missing or not functioning...but nonetheless, David has survived the first few days at home without falling deathly ill. I haven't got a lot of sleep the last few nights and don't expect to get much sleep for awhile. I am either giving medication or a tube feeding to David 11 times a day, then turning him every couple hours at night to prevent sores. We have caregivers coming in so they help lift the burden of care somewhat but I've had to train them all to some extent. Some are painfully slow and don't have a clue about caregiving such a dependent person and others intuitively know how things should be done and are very helpful. It's an interesting experience meeting these caregivers. They have such different personalities from one another but all have an interest in caring for my husband's needs. I've had lots of family support as well, which I wouldn't have been able to make it through the last few days without it. Even though it's hard and I'm overwhelmed, it's all worth it to wake up to my husband's smiling face and him spelling out "Good morning sweetheart!"<br>

"It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. because his compassions fail not." Lamentations 3:22</p>

9/19/13 (Annette Hanson)For four days this week, I had the privilege of spending time with David, Rachel, and Jocelyn. The "settling into home" is a joy and challenge. Rachel cares for David with great love and tenderness, and "Grandma" got to become acquainted more with her sweet little granddaughter. 

David was spelling out things like crazy....things like, "I looooove Rachel" and "We need to pray without ceasing" and "We need to think about John 11:26." To explain a little, this passage of Scripture has been heavy on his mind; so much that it was keeping him up at night until we figured out why it was so important to him. He was thinking a lot about when Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live." David was focused on the next verse which says, "and whoever lives and believes in Me will never die." After a lot of questioning and spelling, David was able to express how he is looking forward to the return of the Lord Jesus Christ to take all who believe in Him up into the clouds to meet Him in the air and be with Him forever. "Whoever lives and believes in Me will never die."

And all who know the Lord can say, "Amen, David!"

<br>(Rachel Hanson) David is a lot more alert these days and hasn't really had hardly any significant headaches for 3 days. He was asking for Vicodin on Monday night and I decided to try some of my PT skills on him, and it seems like it worked!  Yesterday, I was able to stand him upright by myself 4 times and then I helped him do 5 squats. I was really surprised at his strength!
He saw the physiatrist Tuesday and I was very pleased with him and he seems hopeful for more recovery for David. It's nice to have a doctor that hopes with us.
So that's the good news.
The bad news is we're struggling with caregivers. The good ones provide reprieve for me but the bad ones cause chaos and stress. Last night, one lost control of David while transferring him from bed to wheelchair. I was alarmed to find David on his knees on the floor and the caregiver struggling to try to heave him into the chair by herself. Needless to say, I did the rest of the transfers and some of the shower for the night, meanwhile juggling Jocelyn's needs. The lady basically fired herself. Then after 20 minutes of waiting this morning for a new caregiver, she finally showed up after I'd already done half the morning routine. I called the company to try to get real trained staff and they informed me that, not only was my nightmare resigning, but one of my best caregivers is leaving too. 
Pray with me that we would get some good caregivers and pray for the one that resigned. She seemed touched by the gospel.

9/30/13 (Rachel Hanson)There have many "firsts" this year with David. Yesterday was the first time in almost 14 months that David, Jocelyn and I attended breaking of bread together. David and I were raised in homes where you went to church every Sunday unless you were pretty ill. David hasn't been able to go at all this last year and it's been hit and miss for me because of David's health and proximity to an assembly of believers I felt comfortable fellowshipping with. It was incredible to go worship the Lord together yesterday.
We are settling into a routine a little bit more here at home. It's hard work but there's also more down time too. I'm sooo happy not to have to jump in the car for hours every day.
The doctor said I could consolidate some of the medications, which makes things easier. Instead of giving feedings or medications 11 times a day, I'm giving them 5 times a day. I've been having to figure out how much water to give David in addition to tube feedings and puree foods. We take so much for granted.
I need to learn grace with David. I get frustrated and annoyed when he perseverates on one subject for days and months. I'm learning how to divert his attention and redirect. But sometimes I feel disrespectful when I have to be firm with "redirecting". I struggle with my role as a wife and caregiver. I have so many questions. I wish there was a formula how to love perfectly, but alas, my flesh rises up. One + One doesn't always = Two.
"But he giveth more grace..." James 4:6</p>
