<h2>Church Roles</h2>
<span class="lead">There is no difference in value between men and women, but there are distinct roles</span>
<br />The work of Christ has removed all human distinctions of privilege (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gal+3:28&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Gal. 3:28</a>).  And every believer, whether male or female, is a priest to God (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Heb+13:15&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">Heb. 13:15</a>).  As holy priests (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Pet+2:5,9&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Pet. 2:5</a>) and royal priests (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Pet+2:5,9&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Pet. 2:9</a>), we can worship and witness all we desire.
<br />But as in the home, men and women are given distinct roles in the church.  Church order, like chronological or alphabetical order, has nothing to do with importance.  It has been established by God so "<span class="bible">all things <i class="bible">are</i> done decently and in (accordance to the) order</span>" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor+14:40&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 14:40</a>).
<br />Men are to come to church meetings prepared to function publicly as the Spirit leads, representing God to the assembly in the ministry of the Word (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Peter+4:10-11&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Pet. 4:10-11</a>) or representing the assembly to God in prayer and praise.  This is to be done carefully so everyone can add "Amen" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor+14:16&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 14:16</a>).  The women are free to speak to the Lord all they wish, however they must do it silently.  (They are only silent as far as we are concerned-God hears them, as He does the men who are praying silently).  Thus the women have free access to pray and worship as the men do, but are not to usurp authority from the men or act in the church as a representative (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor+14:34;1+Tim+2:11-12&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 14:34; 1 Tim. 2:11-12</a>).

<p><span class="lead">Why do the women wear the head covering?</span>
<br />God's glory is to be seen alone in the assembly of the saints.  In order to do this, the men remain uncovered by not having long hair and by removing any head coverings, because the man is "<span class="bible">the image and glory of God</span>" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+cor+11:7&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 11:7</a>).  Any covering on the man would veil God's glory.  The women, however, are the stewards of the coverings.
<br />There are two competing glories in the church.  "<span class="bible">The woman is the glory of the man</span>" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+cor+11:7&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 11:7</a>).  And "<span class="bible">if a woman have long hair; it is a glory unto her</span>" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+cor+11:15&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 11:15</a>).  Because there are two symbolic glories to be covered, there must be two coverings.  The first covering (Gk., <i>peribolaion</i>) is the woman's long hair (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+cor+11:15&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">v.15b</a>) to hide the glory of the man (the woman herself).  The second covering (Gk., <i>katakalupto</i>) is to hide her glory-her own hair.  In this way, God's authority is declared in the church.  By it the men are reminded that, in their ministry, their glory is to be hidden.  The angels are also instructed by it (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+cor+11:10&version=NKJV" target="_blank" class="plainlink">1 Cor. 11:10</a>).
